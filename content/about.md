Hi,  I am a web / user interface designer with a bachelor’s degree in Media Engineering (B.Eng), acquired at the Georg-Simon-Ohm college of technology in Nuremberg, Germany. The website was built from scratch with the open-source static site framework Hugo.

As a self-taught illustrator I enjoy creating characters with a lot of personality and try my best to enhance my storytelling skills. Currently I am also in the process of incorporating Blender into my workflow.
