"Had a little off-road adventure and got your donkey pal's underbody dirty? Don't worry bud, we've gotchu." - some ad slogan probably.

As some things are too good to be true, you probably realised that the Donkey Wash Inc. is only a fictional enterprise. I tried to design a website which would support the friendly character and demeanor known to donkeys. A fun challenge was to avoid greys in the end result which was resolved by using a complementary color scheme with differing luminosity values. The different L{{< super "C" >}} are there to ensure that color blind people are not left behind in the user experience.
